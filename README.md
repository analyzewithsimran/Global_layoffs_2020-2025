## 📌 Key Highlights

- 📉 3 Million total layoffs
- 🏢 14,000+ companies impacted
- 📊 Average workforce reduction: **20.4%**
- 🤖 AI-related layoffs: **16%**
- 📅 2023 recorded the highest layoffs
- 📈 Overexpansion & M&A were the leading causes

## 🌍 Major Insights

### 🔹 Industry Impact
Layoffs were distributed across sectors including Tech, Finance, Energy, and FinTech.  
Severity was not limited to startups—enterprises were equally affected.

### 🔹 Geographic Concentration
Developed economies (especially North America and Europe) experienced the highest layoffs.

### 🔹 Economic Cycle Influence
The "Tech Correction" period triggered more layoffs than the pandemic impact.

### 🔹 Company Size Analysis
Workforce reduction remained consistent (~20%) across startups, mid-size firms, and enterprises, indicating systemic restructuring rather than size-specific downsizing.

### 🔹 AI vs Non-AI Layoffs
Although AI automation contributed meaningfully (16%), traditional strategic and economic factors remained dominant drivers.
